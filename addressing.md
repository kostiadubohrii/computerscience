## Addressing 

Addressing modes - refers to the way in which the operating system directs ardretrieves data items held in memory
> There are 4 different addressing modes we need to be aware of:
- machine code instructions consist of 2 items ( Operand - address reference of the instruction 
 * address reference  in memory 
 * literal or constant that needs to be loaded
Operand values are determimed by the individyat instruction set determined by the profcessor manufacrurer:

### 1. Immediate addressing refers to the loading of the data item itself into memory 
```
LOAD [321] // load the number 321 into the accumulator 
``` 
### 2. Direct addressing refers to the address reference where tge data items in located LOAD 41 the data item 12 lives there.

### 3. Inderect Addressing accts as a lookup table pints to an address reference in memory which contains the address of the data item to be fetched.
### 4. Indexed Addressing 

### 5. Relative addressing - refers to changes in the address held at the program counter when a branching condition is activated.
