Compilation and translation of program code 
How jprogram gets granslated  into machine code 
1. Lexical analyser - removes white spancce, comments assigns tokens, 
2. Syntax analyser - tokens are checked to see if they match the rules of the language, Backus Naur form( the  rules  for enforcing the syntex ot the language<br>
Checks the spelling and the grammar rules - estavlich the rules of precedence of a language - ccreated an avstra t syntax tree when a set program insturctino are parsed 
then we use Reverse Polish Notation 
3. Code generation and oprimisation <br>
Starts the process of translating each line of High lvl lenguage into processor specific machine code using the instuction set. <br> 

There is one to many relationships between 1 line of HLL code and machine code <br>
Allocates physical addresses where mach9ine code instructions are stored, reginster usage is opromised <br>
###Linking and loading
``` A compilation factor is where programs are using external or internal library functrions and how rherse are managed. Linking can be done in 2 ways the library <br>
itself can be incorporated into the program itself include a complete file for all libraries - tkinter, PyQt, Sqlite, os, datetime, rendom, csv.
