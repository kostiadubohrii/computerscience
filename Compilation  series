a = while n < 10: ##b I am trying to assign variable to key word while
  a = a + 12 

Every pease of code has to pass through the 3 grate test.

Compilation sesies 
1) Lexical analyser - get rid of all whitespaces, comments 
Tokenises the code organises them into token 
5 token 
1. Operators ( +, -, //, div,  == ) 
2. Assigment =
3. Key word - case, switch, while , input , for , if , elif, else, , input, ptint, in , enumerate, range
4. Litterals, constants 
5. User defined variables (arrays, variables, lists, data structure) f
Data dictionary aka symbol data where meta data anout the data structures is stored
Token stream - is the order in which the program instructions are going to be executed as defined by the user

Code at this stage is passed through to the syntax analiser
1) Does the code contain any words not matchibng the dictionary of key word? 

Write the set of rules for setting up Natianal Instruction number 
<letter><letter><digit><digit><digit><digit><letter> 
2
